Inventors are encouraged to anticipate the formation of acronyms by making new terms \"YABA-compatible\" (\"yet another bloody acronym\"), meaning the term's acronym can be pronounced and is not an offensive word: \"When choosing a new name, be sure it is 'YABA-compatible'.\"", "\n", "Acronym use has been further popularized by text messaging on mobile phones with ", " (SMS), and ", " (IM). To fit messages into the 160-character SMS limit, and to save time, acronyms such as \"GF\" (\"girlfriend\"), \"LOL\" (\"laughing out loud\"), and \"DL\" (\"download\" or \"down low\") have become popular.", " Some ", " disdain texting acronyms and abbreviations as decreasing clarity, or as failure to use \"pure\" or \"proper\" English. Others point out that languages have always ", ", and argue that acronyms should be embraced as inevitable, or as innovation that adapts the language to changing circumstances. In this view, the modern practice is just the \"proper\" English of the current generation of speakers, much like the earlier abbreviation of corporation names on ticker tape or newspapers.\n", "Exact pronunciation of \"word acronyms\" (those pronounced as words rather than sounded out as individual letters) often vary by speaker population. These may be regional, occupational, or generational differences, or simply personal preference. For instance, there have been decades of online debate about how to pronounce ", " (", " or ", ") and ", " (", ", ", ", or ", "). Similarly, some letter-by-letter initialisms may become word acronyms over time, especially in combining forms: ", " for ", " is generally said as two letters, but ", " for ", " is usually pronounced as ", " or ", ", along with variant capitalization like \"IPSEC\" and \"Ipsec\". Pronunciation may even vary within a single speaker's vocabulary, depending on narrow contexts. As an example, the database programming language ", " is usually said as three letters, but in reference to ", " is traditionally pronounced like the word ", ".\n", "In writing for a broad audience, the words of an acronym are typically written out in full at its first occurrence within a given text.

In both styles, when one vowel already has a quality diacritic on it, the tone mark must be applied to it as well, regardless of where it appears in the syllable (thus ", " is acceptable while ", " is not). In the case of the ", " diphthong, the mark is placed on the ", ". The ", " in ", " is considered part of the consonant. Currently, the new style is usually used in textbooks published by ", ", while most people still prefer the old style in casual uses. Among Overseas Vietnamese communities, the old style is predominant for all purposes.\n", "In lexical ordering, differences in letters are treated as primary, differences in tone markings as secondary and differences in case as tertiary differences. (Letters include for instance ", " and ", " but not ", ". Older dictionaries also treated digraphs and trigraphs like ", " and ", " as base letters.", ") Ordering according to primary and secondary differences proceeds syllable by syllable. According to this principle, a dictionary lists ", " before ", " because the secondary difference in the first syllable takes precedence over the primary difference in the second syllable.\n", "In the past, syllables in multisyllabic words were concatenated with hyphens, but this practice has died out and hyphenation is now reserved for word-borrowings from other languages.

That system is no longer in common use, but traces can still be found in some frequent current surnames such as ", " (son of Paul), ", ", ", " or ", " (a famous poet who chose the Hungarian form instead of his Slavic birth name, ", ").

For example, in Russian, a man named Ivan with a father named Nikolay would be known as Ivan Nikolayevich or \"Ivan, son of Nikolay\" (", " being a patronymic).

For example, a woman named Mariya Iosifovna Zhukova would hand you a business card that says Zhukova Mariya Iosifovna. Use of the given name followed by the patronymic in Russian is always the neutral, correct and polite way to address any person except close friends, family members, or children – in such cases usage of the patronymic adds humorous intonation of exaggerated but well-meant respect. This form would be congruent to the Western use of Mr. and the surname for the polite and proper use and reference. Instead of schoolchildren calling their teacher Ms. and surname, the proper form would be given name and patronymic. For example, a teacher named Anna Borisovna Kopylova would always be called Anna Borisovna by her pupils. When addressing a much younger person, only the first name is commonly used. Individuals are addressed by their given name followed by the patronymic (e.g., \"Mikhail Nikolayevich\") in many situations including on formal occasions, by colleagues at work, by acquaintances, or when being addressed by someone younger in age.", " It is becoming more common for younger individuals (under 50) to drop the patronymic at work.", " In informal situations, if a person is called by a ", " (such as Misha for Mikhail or Nastya for Anastasia), the patronymic is not used.", "\n", "In ", ", informal speech, it is also possible to contract the ending of a patronymic: thus Nikolayevich becomes Nikolaich, and Stepan Ivanovich becomes Stepan Ivanych or simply Ivanych as the ", " may be omitted altogether.

In contrast to male names, if a woman is called by her patronymic name without a given name, the patronymic is usually not contracted: \"Ivanovna\" but \"Mar' Ivanna\"; \"Sergeyevna\" or \"Sergevna\" is one exception, where both forms are fine. Typically, a patronymic name alone is a familiar form of addressing an older female.\n", " reported in the 19th century that Serbs sometimes used their old family names, and sometimes patronymics. Vuk Karadžić himself used patronymic “Stefanović” (son of Stefan, equivalent of Steven), and sometimes Karadžić, old family name.
