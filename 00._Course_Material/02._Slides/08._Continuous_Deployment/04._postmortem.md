# Cloudflare Incident

https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-incident-on-february-6-2025/

> Weâ€™re deeply sorry for this incident: this was a failure of a number of controls, and we are prioritizing work to implement additional system-level controls related not only to our abuse processing systems, but so that we continue to reduce the blast radius of any system- or human- action that could result in disabling any production service at Cloudflare.

Humans should be expected to fail. Systems should be designed to handle human errors, otherwise it's a failure of the system.
