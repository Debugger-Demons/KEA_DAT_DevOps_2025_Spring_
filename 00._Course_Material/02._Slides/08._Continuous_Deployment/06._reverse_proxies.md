# Reverse proxies

Example: Nginx, Apache, HAProxy, Traefik

*Why have a reverse proxy?*

---

# Why have a reverse proxy?

* Load balancing

* HTTP caching

* Security:

    * port protection in a centralized manner

    * TLS encryption deployed only once (between the reverse proxy and the client rather than than the proxy and every single server)

# Install Nginx locally

Since we are not serving content to the internet from out laptops, it doesn't make sense to install it locally.

This is just to try it out in class. 

MacOS:

```bash
$ brew install nginx
```

Windows:

```bash
$ choco install nginx
```

---

# Find the Nginx configuration directory

Usually on `MacOS`:

```bash
$ ls /usr/local/etc/nginx
```

`Homebrew` put it here instead:

```bash
$ ls /opt/homebrew/etc/nginx
```

`Linux`:

```bash
$ ls /etc/nginx
```

`Windows`:

```bash
$ ls C:\nginx\conf
```

*Open it in your favorite text editor.* Example, you could use the `code` command.

---

# The Nginx configuration file

We have a servers folder.

`nginx.conf` is the file that configures Nginx. 

---

# Start Nginx

```bash
$ nginx
```

Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser.

Nginx is now serving content. We can see that it is served by Nginx by looking at the `Server` response header in the browser's developer tools.

## Stopping Nginx

Graceful stop:

```bash
$ nginx -s quit
```

Force stop:

```bash
$ nginx -s stop
```

Remember to hard refresh your browser. It often caches nginx. 

---

# Nginx configuration

Syntax: 

* Directives have keys and values and are separated by semicolons.

* Contexts are blocks of directives.

*Can you point out examples of both in the `nginx.conf` file?*

# Serving static content - Create `mywebsite`

Create a folder called `mywebsite` somewhere on your computer and put an `index.html` file in it.

In the html file put a greeting message.

---

# Serving static content - Configure Nginx

Delete everything in the `nginx.conf` file and add the following:

```nginx
http {
    server {
        listen  8080;
        root    /absolute/path/to/mywebsite;
    }
}

events {}
```

Nginx will automatically look for an `index.html` file in the root folder.

Create the `index.html`.

*Can you fix the above snippet?*

Check the browser: *Does it work?*

---

# Serving static content - Reload Nginx

It doesn't work. We need to reload Nginx.

```bash
$ nginx -s reload
```

Make a change to the HTML. 

*What will happen if we refresh the browser without reloading Nginx?*

---

# Mime types

Let's add a `styles.css` file to the `mywebsite` folder.

```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}
```

Add a link to the `styles.css` file in the `index.html` file.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

*Does it work? Why or why not? Where can we check? What is wrong?*

---

# Mime types - Debugging

The Nginx server is correctly serving the CSS file.

We can check in the browser's developer tools in the Network tab.

The response header `Content-Type` is set to `text/plain`.

It should be `text/css`.

---

# Mime types - Fixing it

Add a types context to the http context:

```nginx
http {
    types {
        text/css            css;
        text/html           html;
        text/javascript     js;
    }

    ...
}

... 
```

What it does is that it maps the `Content-Type` to the file extension.

Reload Nginx:

```bash
$ nginx -s reload
```

Refresh in the browser. 

It works! But it's not optimal. *Why not?* 


---

# Mime types

But our solution is not ideal. We would have to manually add every mime type.

Nginx has a built-in list of mime types in the file `mime.types`.

Instead of pasting the types context in the `nginx.conf` file, we can include the `mime.types` file.

```nginx
http {
    include     mime.types;

    ...
}
```

*Reload Nginx and test it out.*

---

# Defining a location blocks

Create a folder in `mywebsite` called `myfavoritethings` and create an `index.html` in it that displays some of your favorite things.

Add a location block to the server block in the `nginx.conf` file:

```nginx
http {

    ...

    server {
        listen 8080;
        root /Users/anders/Desktop/mywebsite;

        location /myfavoritethings {
            root /Users/anders/Desktop/mywebsite;
        }
    }
}
...
```

Because the location is `/myfavoritethings`, it will find the `index.html` in the `myfavoritethings` folder.

*Reload Nginx and test it out.*

---

# Location blocks

Reuse the `myfavoritethings` html, but serve it on a different path:

```nginx
http {

    ...

    server {
        ...

        location /generallynicethings {
            alias /Users/anders/Desktop/mywebsite/myfavoritethings;
        }
    }
}
```

So while defining a `root` will append the location to the root, 

`alias` will replace the location with the alias.

---

# Regular expressions in paths

Regular expressions can be defined following the `~*` operator.

```nginx
location ~* /count/[0-9] {
    try_files /count/count.html /index.html =404;
}
```

*What do you think the above location block does?*

We haven't talked about `try_files` but it tries the files in order and `=404` is how we can return an error if everything else fails.

---

# Clean up!

1. Delete the `mywebsite` folder.

2. Replace the content of the `nginx.conf` file with `nginx.conf.default`.

3. Gracefully quit Nginx:

```bash
$ nginx -s quit
```

# Whoknows variations - Continuous Deployment

Let's see on how Nginx has been made to work:

https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/tree/continuous_deployment

There are two approaches to how to configure Nginx as discussed here:

https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/blob/continuous_deployment/tutorials/01._Ways_to_Achieve_Continuous_Deployment.md#deploying-nginx

---

# [The `nginx.conf` file](https://github.com/who-knows-inc/whoknows_variations/blob/continuous_deployment/src/network/nginx.conf)

```nginx
events { }

http {
    server {
        listen 80;

        location / {
            proxy_pass http://whoknows_flask:8080;
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        }
    }
}
```

**Host**: Keeps the original request’s host header.

**X-Real-IP**: Passes the client’s real IP address.

**X-Forwarded-For**: Tracks the client’s IP across proxies.

**X-Forwarded-Proto**: Keeps the original request’s protocol (http or https).
