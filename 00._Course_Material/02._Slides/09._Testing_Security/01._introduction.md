# Let's review your projects!

<!-- todo -->

This is what I have found by using the website as a normal user would. I have not reviewed the security feature for old accounts.

**DebuggerDemons**: The website was down when I tried.

**DevOpsDynamite**: No weather information on the weather page. Missing navigation. Consider creating your own 404 page.

**DevOops23b**: The website was down when I tried.

**PipelinePionee.rs**: No weather page. Can't access the login / signup from the frontpage. 

All groups: Why is the footer not at the bottom of the page?
